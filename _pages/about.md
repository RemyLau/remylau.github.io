Hi there! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in
[Professor Jian Ma](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jianma/)'s group in the
[Ray and Stephanie Lane Computational Biology Department](https://cbd.cmu.edu/)
at Carnegie Mellon University. I currently work on developing computational
and machine learning methods, as well as software, for analyzing and
understanding single-cell epigenomics.

Check out my [CV](files/RenmingLiu_cv.pdf) for more info.
